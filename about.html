<p>
    Caminio Couple is Melvin and Lilia Rivera. We are passionate about walking the Camino de Santiago, a pilgrimage route in Spain. Our journey began in 2022 right after the pandemic world crisis, and since then, we have walked multiple caminos, sharing our experiences and gear lists to help fellow pilgrims. We document our journeys through videos and post them to our YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@caminocouple">Camino Couple</a>. Our content style is less show and tell vlog style and more an extension of how we document our lifes in general through the art of home videos.

    So far we've walked the Camino Frances, Camino Portuguese, Camino Primitivo, and Camino del Norte. Most of these we have walked together but some have been as solo trips. Lilia also walked the Camino Ignaciano in 2025 which is not part of the Camino de Santiago but does overlap with it at times. We are always looking forward to our next camino adventure, and we hope to inspire others to embark on their own journeys.

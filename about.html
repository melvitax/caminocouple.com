    Hello, we are Melvin and Lilia Rivera. We are passionate about walking the Camino de Santiago, a pilgrimage route in Spain. Our journey began in 2022 right after the corona virus pandemic, and since then, we have walked multiple caminos, sharing our experiences and gear lists to help fellow pilgrims. Melvin documents our journeys through videos and post them to our YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@caminocouple">Camino Couple</a> and also on social media platforms. The content style is less show and tell and more an extension of documenting life in general throgh video.

    So far we've walked the Camino Portuguese, Camino Primitivo, Camino del Norte and the Finisterre/Muxia extension together. Lilia has walked  Camino Frances and Camino Ignaciano which is not part of the Camino de Santiago but does overlap with it at times. We are always looking forward to our next camino adventure, and hope to inspire others to embark on their own journeys.

    Originally from Puerto Rico, Melvin is a graphic designer and app developer. On the Camino, he loves the human connections made and the stories told, disconnecting from the every day world and being in nature. Originally from Mexico, Lilia is an independent visual artist. On the camino she loves the intersection of Spirituality, nature, art, history and tradition. Also, she loves the deep human connection with people from all backgrounds especially made possible as one embraces the simplicity of pilgrim life. They have lived in Los Angeles, New York City and currently reside in South Florida.
